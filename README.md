# Traefik Container

This project offers a ready-to-use Docker container, tailor-made to efficiently run [Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/). Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, known for being user-friendly and effective.

Here are some advantages of using Traefik:

- Makes things easier by putting all your apps behind easy-to-remember URLs. Accessing your apps becomes straightforward and efficient.

- Adds a simple but strong HTTP authentication for all your apps. This boosts your apps' security by allowing only authorized users.

- Improves security by including necessary headers directly into your apps' web interfaces. This keeps the user experience smooth, while keeping your apps safe.

- Enhances safety by removing the need for individual app port forwarding. This way, your apps are not exposed directly to the internet, considerably reducing security risks.

- Lastly, Traefik allows automatic operations. This saves time and effort, making the whole process more efficient.
